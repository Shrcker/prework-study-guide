# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

While learning to code within web development environments, it would be prudent to be able to develop a website to apply what I learn in class to a practical environment. I decided that, since I am currently a studying student and there may very well be many others out there like me, that such a site would be a good center for others to reference for their own note-taking and review.
The page is styled in CSS and made functional with JavaScript. Both languages were selected because they are easy to learn and apply, as well as iterate over the course of this project's forseeable lifespan into this next year. 
So far, working on this project has taught me the very basics of both HTML and the afformentioned building blocks I've used. I am hoping to return to this page repeatedly throughout my studies in order to apply more advanced applications of these languages to ultimately dress the site up into a well functioning, and easy to navigate, study repository.

 ## Installation

## Usage

The front-end of the website is a collection of bulleted notes for four different topics, that being HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. These notes are written from a general perspective in respect to a potential audience, making it easier for others to apply such notes to themselves.
Additionally the website will try to suggest to a user which topic they should study into on their current visit. Current implementation is rudimentary, as it exists solely as console outputs using JavaScript's Math.random() method. To use this feature, one must open their browser's DevTools console.
