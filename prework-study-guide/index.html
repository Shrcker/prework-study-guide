          <li>The body element represents the visible content of the page.</li>
          <li>Sections are semantic groupings for thematic groups in the code.</li>
          <li>Sections can have classes and id's assigned to them. Classes and id's can be defined in CSS later.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS code is defined within curly brackets, { }, within a document.</li>
          <li>CSS is good for organizing and creating the visual flairs of a page.</li>
          <li>Classes and id's are usually defined by style sheets near the top of the document, within its own element.</li>

        <h2>GIT</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is a version control system used for organizing our projects non-linearly and collaborate with other developers.</li>
          <li>Github is where we store our project repositories in a cloud format. It's essentially what hosts our Git projects.</li>
          <li>With Git, we can easily track each version of a project and revert to specific states. It's useful for debugging and tracking our progress.</li>
          <li>Anyone can collaborate with online Github projects.</li>
          <li>We can also track known issues or bugs with project versions with Github.</li>
          <li>One can remotely download and access files and repositories onto local work stations.</li>

          <li>I don't know much about Javascript yet, but I do know that it can manipulate and change elements within HTML documents.</li>
          <li>This allows us to add functionality for end user interaction with the webpage. Things like buttons, for instance.</li>
