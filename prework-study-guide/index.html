          <li>CSS is good for organizing and creating the visual flairs of a page.</li>

          <li>Git is a version control system used for organizing our projects non-linearly and collaborate with other developers.</li>
          <li>Github is where we store our project repositories in a cloud format. It's essentially what hosts our Git projects.</li>
          <li>With Git, we can easily track each version of a project and revert to specific states. It's useful for debugging and tracking our progress.</li>
          <li>Anyone can collaborate with online Github projects.</li>
          <li>We can also track known issues or bugs with project versions with Github.</li>
          <li>One can remotely download and access files and repositories onto local work stations.</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we're interacting with.</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and automatically switches to it.</li>
          <li>git merge [branch]: merges the specified branch's history into the current one.</li>
          <li>git log: shows all commits in the current branch's history.</li>
          <li>git fetch [alias]: fetches down all the branches from that Git remote.</li>
          <li>git push [alia] [branch]: transmits local branch commits to the remote repository branch.</li>
          <li>git branch: lists your branches.a, * will appear next to the currently active branch.</li>
          <li>git branch [branch-name]: creates a new branch at the current commit.</li>
          <li>git rebase [branch]: apply any commits of current branch ahead of a specified one.</li>
          <li>git reset --hard [commit]: clear staging area, rewrite working tree from specified commit.</li>

          <li>I don't know much about Javascript yet, but I do know that it can manipulate and change elements within HTML documents.</li>
          <li>This allows us to add functionality for end user interaction with the webpage. Things like buttons, for instance.</li>
